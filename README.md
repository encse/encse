I'm into retro programming, CTFs, a fan of pixel art 
and everything computer related that was build before 2000.
 I have a [nes emulator](https://nes.csokavar.hu), 
some old school [mandelbrot drawers](https://mandelbrot.csokavar.hu) 
or - from my childhood -  a [Rubik's cube solver](https://rubik.csokavar.hu)
in my portfolio here.
