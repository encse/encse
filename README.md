I'm into retro programming, fan of pixelart and everything computer related that was build before 2000. I created a few fun projects during the years: a [nes emulator](https://nes.csokavar.hu), an old school [mandelbrot drawer](https://mandelbrot.csokavar.hu) or - back in the days -  a [Rubik's cube solver](https://rubik.csokavar.hu).
