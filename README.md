I'm into retro programming, CTFs, a fan of pixel-art and everything computer related that was build before 2000.
 I have a [nes emulator](https://nes.csokavar.hu), 
some old school [mandelbrot drawers](https://mandelbrot.csokavar.hu) or - from my childhood -  a [Rubik's cube solver](https://rubik.csokavar.hu)
in my portfolio here.

 🪐 My homepage is [csokavar.hu](https://csokavar.hu/about). The arcade is always open for a quick round of pac-man. You can also `finger @csokavar.hu` for the latest news.
