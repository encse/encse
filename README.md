I'm into retro programming, CTFs, a fan of pixel-art and everything computer related that was build before 2000.
 I have a [nes emulator](https://nes.csokavar.hu), an old school [mandelbrot drawer](https://mandelbrot.csokavar.hu) or - from my childhood -  a [Rubik's cube solver](https://rubik.csokavar.hu)
app amongst other things here.

 🪐 My homepage is [csokavar.hu](https://csokavar.hu/about). The arcade is always open for a quick round of pac-man. You can also check out `finger @csokavar.hu` for the latest news.
