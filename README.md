- 🔭 I’m currently working for [Formlabs](https://formlabs.com), previously at [prezi](https://prezi.com), Mobilengine and Intentsoft.
- ✨ I work as an architect, connect multiple components and love complex challenges.
- 🌱 In my freetime, I'm into retro programming, pixelart, everything computer related that was build before 2000. I created a few fun projects during the years: a [nes emulator](https://nes.csokavar.hu), an old school [mandelbrot drawer](https://mandelbrot.csokavar.hu), or - back in the days -  a [Rubik's cube solver](https://rubik.csokavar.hu).
